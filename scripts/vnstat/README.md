This is a basic script page for using [vnstat]. 

Using these scripts require installation of [vnstat] package.

Any additional configs on [vnstat] command requires the name of interfaces.
These interfaces could be found using the command [ifconfig]. This command could be installed using the package [net-tools]. 

In this file, two interfaces used are [wlan0] for wifi and [tailscale0] for tailscale. These interfaces could be changed according to user needs and demands. If the user has more than given interfaces, same command could be repeated with the other interface.
